<h3>Know your enemy</h3>
</p>

<p>As you progress into the game, you will encounter a number of vicious enemy agents that will try to drive your car from the road or send you heading straight for the nearest tree. The enemies you will encounter are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<table border="0">
 <tr>
  <td><img align="left" src="Car_Crasher.jpg">
  <b>Crasher.</b> The first type of car you will encounter. These cars are relatively harmless and attack you by ramming you from the side or from behind. They will try to push you off the side of the road.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img align="left" src="Car_Blade.jpg">
  <b>Blade.</b> This enemy is a much nastier piece of work. These cars have retractable knives fitted to their wheels. If you are rammed from the side by a Blade vehicle when the knives are fully extended, your tyres will burst causing you to spin out of control off the road. Be very careful of these cars!</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img align="left" src="Car_Jeep.jpg">
  <b>Jeep.</b> The Jeep is bullet-proof, and no amount of attack from your machine guns will get this car out of your way. The only ways to destroy these cars are to push them off the side of the road, or to use oil or smoke in front of them so that they drive off the side of the road.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><img align="left" src="Helicopter.jpg">
  <b>Chopper.</b> Hovering above you and able to follow you wherever you go, the Chopper can make quite a nuisance of itself. It will drop bombs in front of you that create huge craters in the road, causing massive damage to any car that should drive over them. The Chopper can only be destroyed using Surface-to-Air Missiles, available from a weapons van, though it will fly away on its own when it runs out of bombs to drop.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">
<h3>Civilian cars</h3>
</p>

<p>The roads are also full of innocent members of the public going about their daily lives.</p>

<table border="0">
 <tr>
  <td><img src="Car_Civilian1.jpg"><img src="Car_Civilian2.jpg"></td>
  <td width="100%" valign="top"><b>Civilian cars.</b> These come in a variety of models and colours. You should be careful not to shoot these vehicles under any circumstances.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<h3>Graphics Options</h3>
</p>

<p>Selecting <b>Options</b> and then <b>Graphics options</b> from the main menu will allow you to configure the graphics settings for the game. These are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Resolution</dt>
 <dd>Sets the screen resolution for the game. Higher resolutions will show a much crisper picture, but may cause the game to slow down.</dd>

 <dt>Filtering</dt>
 <dd>Switches filtering on and off. When switched on, the graphics will have a much smoother appearance at the possible expense of performance.</dd>

 <dt>Anti-aliasing</dt>
 <dd>Switches anti-aliasing on and off. When switched on, the edges of objects will have a much smoother appearance at the possible expense of performance.</dd>

 <dt>Brightness</dt>
 <dd>Allows the brightness level of the game to be increased if the game appears too dark.</dd>

 <dt>Vertex calculation</dt>
 <dd>Controls whether the 3d graphics are calculated by the processor (software) or the graphics card(hardware). Normally this should be set to hardware but it can be changed if problems occur.</dd>

<h3>Sound Options</h3>
</p>

<p>Selecting <b>Options</b> and then <b>Sound options</b> from the main menu will allow you to configure the sound settings for the game. These are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<h3>Controller Options</h3>
</p>

<p>Selecting <b>Options</b> and then <b>Controller options</b> from the main menu will allow you to configure the controls for the game. These are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Controller</dt>
 <dd>Allows the keyboard or a compatible joystick, gamepad or steering wheel to be selected. If no items are displayed here other than the keyboard, Highway Pursuit did not recognise any other compatible control devices.</dd>

 <dt>Controller sensitivity</dt>
 <dd>Allows the sensitivity of the selected controller to be set. If the car is not cornering quickly enough, increase the sensitivity; if it is turning too sharply, decrease it.</dd>

 <dt>Dead zone</dt>
 <dd>Sets the size of the "dead zone" when using a joystick/pad or steering wheel. This defines how far away from centre the controller must be moved before the car starts to steer. With the dead zone off, even the slightest move will cause your car to steer; a larger dead zone will need a larger movement of the stick/wheel before the car starts to steer.</dd>

 <dt>Define controls</dt>
 <dd>Allows the keyboard and controller buttons to be configured to your liking. A separate set of controls are maintained for both keyboard and joystick, so you can configure the controls however you like for each controller.</dd>

 <dt>Use joystick for menus</dt>
 <dd>If set to Yes and the Controller is set to a joystick/gamepad/wheel, you will be able to use this controller to navigate the menus as well as play the game. Use the controls that are configured for up and down to move through the menus, left and right to change selections and fire to select menu options.</dd>

<h3>High score Options</h3>
</p>

<p>Selecting <b>Options</b> and then <b>High score options</b> from the main menu will allow you to configure the high score settings. These are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<dl>
 <dt>Upload high scores</dt>
 <dd>Highway Pursuit is written to support the Retrospec on-line high score table, and will allow each score to be added to the table. You can either add your scores by entering a code into the Retrospec web site, or you can get Highway Pursuit to upload the scores automatically.
 <p>
 Setting this option to "after every game" will instruct Highway Pursuit to connect to the high score server immediately after you have entered your name into the game's own high score table. This is recommended for when you are playing with a permanent internet connection.
 <p>
 Setting this option to "only from main menu" will instruct the game to only attempt to upload the high scores when you select "Upload high scores" from the main menu. This is recommended for dial-up internet connections.
 <p>
 For more information on the Retrospec on-line high score tables, visit the <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net/">Retrospec web site</a>.
 </dd>

 <dt>Clear high score table</dt>
 <dd>This will erase all entries from your local high score table. Ensure you have uploaded any scores to the internet before doing this, as once cleared these scores cannot be recovered.</dd>

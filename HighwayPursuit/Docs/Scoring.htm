<h3>Scoring</h3>
</p>

<p>Your score slowly increases all the time you are driving, but to really increase your score you will need to take out as many enemy cars as you can. Try not to let any enemy vehicle get away from you: every one has a price on its head.</p>

<p>The points awarded for your actions in the game are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<center>
<table border="0">
 <tr><td>Destroy an enemy Crasher car:</td><td align="right">500 points</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Destroy an enemy Blade car:</td><td align="right">1,000 points</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Destroy an enemy Jeep car:</td><td align="right">1,500 points</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Destroy a helicopter:</td><td align="right">5,000 points</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Docking with a weapons van:</td><td align="right">500 points</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
</blockquote>

<p>If you destroy a civilian car, all scoring will be suspended for five seconds. During this period, "...no score..." will be displayed at the top of the screen instead of your game score.</p>

<p>You will be given an extra life at 100,000 and 200,000 points.</p>

<h3>Score multipliers</h3>
</p>

<p>If you manage to destroy a number of enemy cars within a very short space of time, each subsequent car will have its points multiplied to really pump up the score.</p>

<p>If you destroy two cars within two seconds, the second car will have its score multiplied by two. If you can then destroy a third car within the next two seconds, its score will be multiplied by three. Continue to destroy cars within these two second intervals and the following cars will have their points multiplied by four and then ten. It can be tricky to get this to work but it can lead to some impressive scores!</p>

<p>Each time you destroy a car with a multipler, a symbol will be displayed on the screen to indicate how the score was multiplied.</p>

<h3>High scores</h3>
</p>

<p>After each game if your score is good enough you can add your name to the high score table.</p>

<p>Highway Pursuit is also able to connect to the on-line Retrospec high score table, which gathers the best scores of players from all over the world.</p>

<p>There are three ways to add your score to the on-line high score table:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Automatic upload after every game
<dd>If you have a permanent internet connection (cable or ADSL, for example) you can configure Highway Pursuit to automatically upload every score as soon as you enter your name. This can be configured by setting "Upload high scores" to "after every game" in the highscore <a href="Settings.htm">settings</a>. Highway Pursuit will immediately tell you where you placed in the Retrospec high score table after each game.
<dt>Automatic upload from the main menu
<dd>If you do not have a permanent internet connection, uploading after every game is probably not practical as you will most likely not be connected to the internet. Highway Pursuit can upload all of your top ten scores at once by selecting "Upload high scores" from the main menu. To configure the upload in this way, set "Upload high scores" to "only from main menu" in the highscore settings. Make sure you connect to the internet before trying to upload the scores.
<dt>Code entry on the Retrospec web site
<dd>If you do not wish to automatically upload your scores automatically (or are having problems getting the game to connect to the high score server), you can manually enter a Score Code on the <a href="http://retrospec.sgn.net">Retrospec web site</a> instead. If the "Upload high scores" setting is set to "only from main menu", your score code will be displayed at the bottom of the high score table after each game. It will also be displayed if the "after every game" upload fails to connect.
<p>You should write the code down carefully, making a careful note of upper-case and lower-case letters. If you need the code to be re-displayed later, the "Upload high scores" option will display any codes that it couldn't upload. To help differentiate between letters, numbers and punctuation characters, the code is coloured as follows:
<p>
 <ul>
 <li>Upper-case letters: green.
 <li>Lower-case letters: blue.
 <li>Numbers: red.
 <li>Punctuation characters: white.
 </ul>
</dl>
<p>Each score code may only be used once. You will not be able to re-upload or re-enter a code that has already been added to the on-line high score table.

<h3>Game objective</h3>
</p>

<p>Highway Pursuit puts you in control of a powerful sports car in a world filled with <a href="Enemies.htm">enemy agents</a> seeking to take control of the road. Your mission is to destroy as many of these enemy agents as possible, without putting any civilian life at risk.</p>

<p>Along the way you will encounter varied terrain and weather conditions, a number of different enemy vehicles intent on your destruction, and also a few helping pointers from your colleague Ashley back at HQ.</p>

<p>Can you make it to the top of the high score table?</p>

<h3>Your car</h3>

<p>Your car is equipped with a front-mounted machine gun, which is your main weapon for use against the enemy cars. You have unlimited ammunition for the machine gun, but be careful not to hit the civilian vehicles when firing.</p>

<p>The car is also capable of being upgraded with a number of add-on weapons. These are described in the <a href="Weapons.htm">extra weapons</a> section of this document. Additional weapons that are fitted will be displayed as a glowing icon at the bottom/left of the screen.</p>

<p>In the bottom/right of the screen is a speedometer that displays how fast your car is currently moving. Immediately above this is the health display (a red heart icon). As your car sustains damage, the health will slowly deplete. When it runs out, your car explodes and you lose a life. Health recharges very slowly over time as you drive along. A small health boost is also given for docking with any weapons van, and a larger boost for docking with the repair van (which also displays a heart icon on its roof).</p>

<p>Drive with care to avoid damaging your car. You must stay on the road at all times; straying on to the grass will cause severe damage to your (or any other) vehicle. This can be a useful way of dispatching enemy cars, however: ramming them off the edge of the road can cause extreme damage to their cars.</p>
